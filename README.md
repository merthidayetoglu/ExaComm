# HiCCL

HiCCL is a GPU-Aware communication library. It has a compositional API for separating the collective pattern design from the machine-specific optimizations. It offers the Expand and Fold primitives to design complicated collective communication patterns. HiCCL then optimizes the primitive pattern for a specified machine, that is described by the user.
